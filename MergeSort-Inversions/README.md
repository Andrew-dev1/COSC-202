# Preference Similarity using Merge Sort

## Data Structure/Algorithm
**Merge Sort with Inversion Counting**

## Description
This assignment calculates the similarity between two preference lists by counting inversions using merge sort. The algorithm converts preference lists into arrays, counts inversions during the merge process, and calculates a similarity ratio based on the number of inversions.

## Key Components
- `Preferences.java`: Implements merge sort with inversion counting to calculate `preferenceSimilarity()` between two preference lists
