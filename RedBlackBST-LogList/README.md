# Logarithmic List Implementation

## Data Structure/Algorithm
**Red-Black Binary Search Tree (BST)**

## Description
This assignment implements a logarithmic-time list data structure (`LogList`) using a Red-Black BST as the underlying data structure. The implementation provides O(log n) time complexity for insert, get, and delete operations by using fractional keys and rank-based node finding.

## Key Components
- `LogList.java`: Main implementation of the logarithmic list using Red-Black BST
- `MyBST.java`: Custom BST extending RedBlackBST
- `RedBlackBST.java`: Base Red-Black BST implementation with rotation and balancing
- `Node.java`: Node class for the BST with color and size tracking
