# Semantic Similarity using Cosine Similarity

## Data Structure/Algorithm
**Hash Map for Vector Representation and Cosine Similarity Calculation**

## Description
This assignment calculates semantic similarity between words using cosine similarity. The implementation builds a co-occurrence matrix using hash maps, where each word is represented as a vector based on its co-occurrences with other words in sentences. The similarity is calculated using the cosine of the angle between word vectors.

## Key Components
- `SemanticSimilarity.java`: Implements word co-occurrence tracking using nested hash maps and calculates cosine similarity between word pairs
