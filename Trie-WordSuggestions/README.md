# Trie with Edit Distance

## Data Structure/Algorithm
**Trie (Prefix Tree) with Edit Distance Algorithm**

## Description
This assignment implements a Trie data structure for efficient word storage and retrieval, with a focus on finding word suggestions based on edit distance. The implementation supports insertion, lookup, and suggestion generation using dynamic programming concepts for calculating edit distance (substitution, insertion, deletion).

## Key Components
- `Trie.java`: Main Trie implementation with `suggestions()` method that finds words within a given edit distance from a target word
