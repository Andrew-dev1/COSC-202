# Zero Matrix Rows and Columns

## Data Structure/Algorithm
**Hash Set for Matrix Manipulation**

## Description
This assignment implements an algorithm to zero out entire rows and columns in a matrix where a zero element is found. The solution uses hash sets to track which rows and columns need to be zeroed, then applies the changes in a second pass.

## Key Components
- `ZeroRowCol.java`: Implements `zeroRowCol()` method that modifies a matrix in-place to zero out rows and columns containing zeros
