# String Concatenation Optimization

## Data Structure/Algorithm
**Dynamic Programming**

## Description
This assignment implements a dynamic programming solution to find the optimal order for concatenating strings. The algorithm uses a 2D grid to store subproblem solutions and calculates the minimum cost of concatenating strings in different orders.

## Key Components
- `ConcatSequence.java`: Contains the dynamic programming implementation with `OPT()` method that builds a grid to find optimal concatenation costs.
