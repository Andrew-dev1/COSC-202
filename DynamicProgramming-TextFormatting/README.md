# Text Formatting with Dynamic Programming

## Data Structure/Algorithm
**Dynamic Programming for Optimal Line Breaking**

## Description
This assignment implements a dynamic programming solution for formatting text with optimal line breaks. The algorithm minimizes the sum of squared slack (unused space) at the end of each line by finding the optimal break points using a bottom-up DP approach.

## Key Components
- `PrettyPrint.java`: Main implementation using dynamic programming to find optimal word breaks
- `SlackFunctor.java`: Interface for calculating slack cost functions
