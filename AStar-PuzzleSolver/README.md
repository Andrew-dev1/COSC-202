# Tile Puzzle Solver using A* Search

## Data Structure/Algorithm
**A* Search Algorithm with Priority Queue**

## Description
This assignment implements the A* search algorithm to solve sliding tile puzzles. The algorithm uses a priority queue to explore board states, with a Manhattan distance heuristic to guide the search toward the goal state. It maintains a visited set to avoid revisiting states.

## Key Components
- `Puzzle.java`: Implements `solvePuzzle()` using A* search with Manhattan distance heuristic and priority queue for state exploration
