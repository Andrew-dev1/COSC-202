# Specimen Comparison using Graph Algorithms

## Data Structure/Algorithm
**Graph Traversal (Depth-First Search) with Union-Find Concepts**

## Description
This assignment processes specimen comparisons to determine species relationships. The algorithm builds a graph from "same species" pairs, uses DFS to find connected components (species groups), checks for contradictions with "different species" pairs, and identifies remaining comparisons needed to resolve ambiguities.

## Key Components
- `Specimens.java`: Main implementation using graph algorithms and DFS to process specimen comparisons
- `Pair.java`: Helper class representing pairs of specimens
