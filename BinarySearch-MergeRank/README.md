# Finding Rank in Two Sorted Lists

## Data Structure/Algorithm
**Binary Search**

## Description
This assignment implements an efficient algorithm to find the kth smallest element (rank) in two sorted lists without merging them. The solution uses binary search to partition the lists and find the element at the specified rank in O(log(min(m, n))) time complexity.

## Key Components
- `FindRank.java`: Main algorithm using binary search to find the kth element
- `SortedList.java`: Wrapper class for sorted lists with query counting functionality
